Hello My Name is Taylor,
I am originally from Ann Arbor Michigan but I currently live in Fruit Heights Utah. If you don't know where that is its north salt lake. I live close to Lagoon. I am Married and have a 5 month old daughter Named Carter. We also have a 2 year old Australian Shepherd named Tucker. If you so feel inclined, You can check him out on Instagram, ( @Living_with_Tucker ). I am a Senior in School and I am Starting my 2nd to last Semester of School. I am Studying Data Science. Currently my wife works as a Data Engineer for Overstock. She also graduated with a Data Science Degree. Things that I enjoy doing are Playing basketball or Ultimate frisbee. I also enjoy going to lift at the gym. Recently I have started to pick up on learning how to cook and have really enjoyed that. While My wife works, I attend school, work as a Real estate Agent and take care of Carter full time. It has been an adjustment for me being a stay at home dad while I finish school but I have loved watching Carter grow and develop.
